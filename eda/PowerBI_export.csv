/content/drive/MyDrive/RealTime-ASR-Project/dataset/cleaned/2412-153947-0003.wav,THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER,9.515,32,178,2412
/content/drive/MyDrive/RealTime-ASR-Project/dataset/cleaned/2412-153947-0004.wav,I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY,8.72,27,153,2412
